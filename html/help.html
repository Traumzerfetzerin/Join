            <h3>What is Join</h3>

            <p><mark>Join</mark> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                dedicated
                students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>

            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <mark>Join</mark> leverages the principles of
                kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that <mark>Join</mark> is designed as an educational exercise and is not
                intended
                for
