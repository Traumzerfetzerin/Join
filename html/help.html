            <h3>What is Join</h3>

            <p><mark>Join</mark> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                dedicated
                students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>

            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <mark>Join</mark> leverages the principles of
                kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that <mark>Join</mark> is designed as an educational exercise and is not
                intended
                for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

                <div>
                    <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                    <p>When you log in to <mark>Join</mark>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your
                        project and
                        contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                    <p>In <mark>Join</mark>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                        "Contacts"
                        section,
                        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                        be

                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                        dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>

                            deleting
                            cards, as this action is irreversible.
